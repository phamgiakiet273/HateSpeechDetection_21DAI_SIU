1,,one g@@ ests to be here i@@ 'm just dick@@ in around i want to get my drink in the camera star@@ tal@@ ready@@ but anyway really important this video i whether you@@ 're a fan or not of me@@ if,
2,,if i might holdin iss,
3,,if you are at all,
4,,a fan of seeing food@@ age of video games on the internet of any sort wh@@ ith they were@@ talking video clips,
5,,video clips of play-@@ thr@@ ou@@ gs whether we@@ 're talking live streaming plat@@ ers streaming of tournaments like street@@ tournaments star@@ craft tournaments l@@ duty tournaments m,
6,,coverage of e-@@ three video of @@ es ind e-@@ three that@@ 's just going over the internet,
7,,there is a bill that was created that is currently being debated on by th@@ ares against its up for approval or@@ whatever and possibly will be signed into law,
8,,in this bill the bill is s period nine-@@ seven,
9,,her@@ ese with the intent of the bil@@ -@@ ness the bill is int@@ ending that they do n't wo@@ wt people streaming ti@@ be movies that kind of copy@@ ri@@ ghting content over the internet because,
10,,and the sni@@ l these studios are worried about it they worry that their losing pro@@ @@ ts with his people are du@@ in,
11,,doing this kind of stuff over the internet now@@ the goal of the bill @@ not only make it illegal but to have very serious legal consequences for @@ number one you could possibly have massive civil finds which were talking thousands op@@ on thousands of dollars and number two you could actually go to jail for this bu@@ believed upto five years you can go to jail for doing it,
12,,i can understand,
13,,where they@@ 're coming from there with movies ant@@ v and that kind of media that is is not changing its not a changing interactive media,
14,,wh@@ et i dil understand is that this bill if it goes through the wae worded right-@@ now will actually also apply to video games because video games are considered copy@@ right@@ end works naz@@ ov@@ right now it@@ 's perfectly legal to stre@@ ant@@ our@@ nament footage of a video game to stream a play@@ @@ @@ @@ @@ iam or to @@ blo videos of a video game and especially with live commentary for doing commentary on @@ @@ as@@ ically,
15,,making it a trans@@ formative work which makes it completely legal@@ youre doing your own commentary criticism you@@ 're turning into a transformed work,
16,,other people have also made the argument that just gameplay of video games is completely legal to foot on internet because just the act of you picking up the controller,
17,,an actually interacting with the game creates something that@@ 's far different an just watching a stag@@ movi@@ er tv show that ever changes this your interaction with the game creates a trans@@ formative work@@ ow@@ the problem is the way the bil@@ la@@ 's worded says that copy@@ @@ ghted works can@@ not be publicly displayed or performed with@@ ou@@ the permission of the copyright holder so essentially what this means is if i wan@@ te to a play through of,
18,,my war f@@ ay@@ r three and im n@@ thro@@ the campaign i need to get exclusive permission from,
19,,acti@@ vision@@ -@@ infinity r who@@ er you wan@@ ts@@ ay@@ he copyright holder of the game todo that and not only interest the campaign but the multi@@ players i want ta record a match of you playin to@@ gan multiplayer put on the internet i@@ ' @@ go und of my way to get exclusive permission from this company ake a @@ d-@@ guest if ior email act@@ division if they@@ 're ever gon@@ ta email me back and@@ tell me if i ge@@ do@@ v permission to do a play throughout their gam@@ ei@@ 'm just never g@@ onto get a response because they@@ 're big company they do n't care about that kind o@@ suff@@ theyre worried about developing games@@ now,
20,,here@@ 's the set okay,
21,,because it@@ 's worded incorrectly this bill if it does go into law you@@ 're talking literally entire businesses wi@@ 'll go out of business m@@ chin@@ for one m,
22,,any other company that puts this kind of footage on te internet half of y@@ ut@@ u@@ bes going have to be taken down@@ n@@ to be an insane amount of work to take down all these video game footage video you now wha@@ anyone who has partnership with thes@@ e@@ plate things h@@ 's gon@@ ta be taken it@@ 's just s ridiculous it@@ 's absolutely ridiculous no@@ i believe that the law@@ o the way that works ou have to make more than twenty-@@ five hundred dollars in a year,
23,,arm,
24,,in order to illegally liable and also you need to have ten ten strikes meaning i could upload nine videos of video game footage and i@@ 'm fine,
25,,as long as someone asked me to take it down i take it oun but if i ope@@ lowed a tens that@@ 's it@@ broken the law and i can either get master fines or i could go to@@ cha@@ il@@ no,
26,,first of all i@@ 'm not being@@ an alarm ist here saying o@@ hoh my god the house@@ 's burning down@@ is the end of internet as we know oka but,
27,,there@@ 's a couple thinks first of all this bill is very early its just got introduced i believe in may and it jus just talked about it for the first time on june twentieth so@@ it@@ 's not,
28,,it@@ 's not close to being passed yet eh,
29,,the thing is a lot of major media alli@@ ds like tol@@ are really pushing hard to get this bill past@@ i have n,
30,,i have no problem with the if they were amended to make pl@@ ucking sense the problem is a lot of our lawmakers are out of touch with reality out-@@ of touch with how the internet really works what@@ 's actually on@@ places like you to and there just us listening to the lobby@@ ests who are talking into their ears saying @@ ep@@ at@@ is whose people are downloading movies anan it@@ 's not fair and ea makes@@ es t wich av@@ eable to steal o broadcasting ver@@ over the n@@ @@ net bus just pass the and hey@@ re not understanding the rec@@ ussions of the on other forms of media primarily video games in@@ partic@@ ular@@ so talking just about me i@@ 'm saying sp@@ uk@@ igu@@ ys on he west co@@ a@@ sta@@ po@@ logi@@ ze as i forgot te@@ ir name that the@@ y-@@ stream stream fight re@@ tournaments anyone who streams any gaming whatsoever will be shut down i@@ 'll be shut down anyone who puts gaming foo@@ to@@ ge will be shut down and so now ges@@ w@@ ols can happen workin to go back to dark ages before the internet where you do n't know if@@ the games good or not because you can't actually see footage of it@@ you can't actually get an honest review ofi,
31,,ic@@ om@@ pletely flipped on his head is all is freedom of information that ha olis tec@@ technological advances that weve had is gonna go away@@ but it does@@ n't only apply to video games think about this there@@ 's alot of people who on you@@ to have actually made it big singing @@ @@ oke @@ ver was one of im just in a couple other people of ach@@ ig@@ sign@@ because they were playing so@@ @@ other artist sand they sang it@@ and they made it big ano@@ ter@@ go@@ @@ gues what@@ this makes that illegal too you can't do that because that@@ 's copy@@ ri@@ ghted music and you can't put that on the internet how dr you sing oc@@ ari@@ oke song on the internet that@@ 's gon@@ ta make it illegal to that@@ 's how absurd this ab@@ ill@@ itness in its current form and@@ its its ludicrous allot of people are buzzing about this ultra david from the sar@@ ca community over@@ un@@ a@@ but a large article about@@ an@@ asa lawyer so he knows ist@@ uff and very ey concern that he@@ 's like how@@ can lawmakers,
32,,try to pass a bill without understanding the entire situation of what it il actually affect in its cur@@ form through being very lazy basically an@@ the@@ being very unprofessional in their jobs ad te@@ basically risking business the risking big business i mean there@@ 's a lot of people who are making money off this kind of th@@ ig@@ and there@@ 's nothing wrong with@@ t actually promotes for example the video games music or whatever it is that being used again being used properly i do not in any way con@@ doned just uploading of v show or uploading or streaming a movie over the uter@@ net for free@@ ant@@ people s@@ ically stealing an da@@ x nop@@ right t i completely incorrect you should not be able to o but a ie@@ o@@ game play-@@ through promo@@ ts@@ your game shows people enjoying the game shows people with the games like makes tho want to go@@ -off and by@@ it it@@ 's a no@@ brainer that this stuff is some@@ kind of thing thas hurting business is actually helping business ad@@ government is not understanding this because again t jus how these won@@ dru@@ ple-@@ o@@ ous whispering in their er and@@ theyre not@@ thinking it through,
33,,the@@ ther this might never een get pa@@ se because traditionally what happens in our i do n't no y novel@@ lize international fans i just saw in my latest ask te episode that forty-@@ five percent of my viewers are actually international which huge ven know that@@ @@ tin the when typically happens as when they tre@@ dito @@ pass all of a sudden some@@ on@@ tried to ack something else on@@ o@@ the so you@@ 'll have a built for this like this and@@ the@@ till say y@@ eb@@ we have to make sure that in indi@@ ana it@@ 's illegal to fuk coats because t@@ ere was a guy@@ li@@ se@@ fi dat@@ fuk to o and we got stock those dirty gol@@ t@@ fun@@ kers so wer@@ er to@@ put an amendment on the that is an indi@@ ana it@@ 's illegal to fun@@ kl go@@ an@@ sometimes yo just,
34,,wha@@ tt@@ e@@ funct does ot have to do with the bill at hand@@ and they do alot of times these bills cause they tri@@ so much done at want the@@ 'll put forty things on the bill and only two of overly are related and the re@@ sto@@ o bunch a ship@@ is what happens in the in@@ @@ legal e not @@ @@ @@ government is the great govern@@ ment@@ so any@@ way@@ that might hold up any@@ kind of decision that would be made about this bill,
35,,arm,
36,,i really do n't for@@ see that the bill its pass anytime soon traditionally these hen@@ det@@ ings take a while there gonna argue on each side there en a hal@@ sh@@ -out the builder and try to change it a little bit,
37,,what i@@ 'm really am hoping is that people hear people like mee@@ x@@ pla@@ ining to the over@@ nal@@ is@@ n this is not right what you@@ 're doing is a blanket law that@@ '@@ is actually going to hinder business,
38,,and,
39,,basically shut down freedom of information on the you@@ are basically going to go back to the@@ dark ages before the existed because you@@ 're making a law that@@ 's were@@ into @@ @@ fit a very few little small@@ businesses that were r@@ nam@@ ic movies and films and you@@ 're fuc@@ ting over a completely new industry that was created by the inter@@ net@@ so@@ yet have to think before you ac you@@ have to think before you pas@@ se this bill it needs to be amended or changed before its pas@@ se in its current form,
40,,now@@ wha@@ l can you@@ as an individual if you are u@@ f@@ citiz@@ en@@ you have the right to help o@@ you can write your person plain@@ id@@ on@@ 't believe that this bill is correct in its current form im@@ not that i-@@ supporting piracy or anything like anyway but@@ is going to negatively affect lots of different things that have happened people will be li@@ ssing kar@@ io@@ ki songs on un@@ ter@@ net anymore people w@@ vr be able o overview of a video game fe@@ o@@ wil will be able to do so many things th@@ ath@@ ave helped business ay,
