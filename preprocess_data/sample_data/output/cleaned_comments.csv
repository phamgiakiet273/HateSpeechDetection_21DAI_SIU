7,Wait a minute there's killings crimes and wars in America but we're focusing on the online gaming??? wtf?,,12 năm trước
8,Is it me or does DSP look like Ethan Mars from Heavy Rain in this video a bit? lol,,11 năm trước
9,Instead of getting this country out of debt our Government is banning video games instead?,,13 năm trước
10,So basically this bill will take away the ability of Game Developers to freely advertise their games via the players Not only will this shut down businesses that revolve around streaming gameplay but will also probably cut down on sales of the video game itself I like many people don't go out and buy games until I see some gameplay in action,,12 năm trước
11,Why the heck these old videos keep showing up in my notifications?,,7 năm trước
12,Ahh man the good old days of dsp,,4 năm trước

16,when phil was awesome back then and now,,5 năm trước
17,A world without game reviews is a world I can't live in,,13 năm trước
18,I looked this up on Wikipedia and it said that the people who are pushing for this bill to be passed said that the bill will only target websites or people who profit from illegally streaming copyrighted material So videogame vids won't be affected,,13 năm trước
19,Wish this bill passed just to get DSP locked up,,1 năm trước
20,Dave i know right when Phil was famous,,5 năm trước
21,That's because he actually sounds relatively knowledgeable and polished here with less of his trademark negative behavioral qualities that define his normal video game playthroughs,,1 tháng trước
22,If he had actually acted like he does in this video as opposed to how he normally acts in most of his other videos maybe he wouldn't be as to the same degree that he is now,,1 tháng trước
23,Hey there 2 years ago you just now it got recommended to me as soon as I opened up youtube on the very first row for some reason Youtube works in mysterious ways,,4 năm trước

25,Egg Shen lol I bet you dont watch him anymore,,4 năm trước
26,Sure,,9 ngày trước
27,I did a little Research and found that 2 of the Politicians behind the bill statet that the bill does NOT affect the Gaming Vids Additionally it was said that only commercial streaming is issued So dont panic folks there is nearly no risk for the Gaming Vid scene,,13 năm trước
28,Thank you Dpsming I did not know this and thank you phill,,9 năm trước
29,GUYS CALM DOWN!!! The Legislative branch proposes silly bills like this all the time besides it's been months this bill will most likely be dismissed and it probably has already they just didn't bother to announce it just calm down we're fine thumbs up so others can see this,,12 năm trước
30,Wait what's so wrong about this video? Why are people whining in the comments?,,9 năm trước
31,i love you phil i follow you everywhere i love you huge fan don't worry about the hates there mother didn't love them Enough,,8 năm trước
32,How does this have so many views? Seems pretty obvious that Phil bought views,,9 năm trước
33,Everyone that doesn't support this bill best idea is to contact Congress and tell them that if this bill gets passed everyone in office who supported it will get voted out! No exceptions!,,12 năm trước
34,I am now really ticked off Why the hell does this video have 23000 likes yet good YouTubers like Chuggaaconroy never got that many likes on a video before? People are idiots,,9 năm trước
35,aww is baby going to have to get a real job awww,,10 năm trước
36,Seriously why does the government focus on less important stuff like the internet instead of other issues? This is America not North Korea If this bill passes EVERYONE BREAK THE LAW!!!,,12 năm trước
37,And it has gotten worse The Senate version of the bill does not criminalise the viewing of videos but some analysis of the House version of the bill just made public would criminalise viewing The House version is so bad that even private streaming just your yourself would be a felony under the house version,,12 năm trước
38,I agree we should definitely stop this If it passes we must all write letters and emails asking for permission and fill their offices and servers until they get rid of it,,12 năm trước
39,If this bill is passed the government has the power to charge you with copyright infringement regardless of the copyright holders take on the situation,,12 năm trước
40,Go and sign the petition it will take you 2 minutes and will help us all A LOT,,13 năm trước
41,It's alright America we TOTALLY understand that ONLINE GAMING is FAR more important that putting REAL criminals in prison,,12 năm trước
42,Putting anyone in prison for just this reason would be entirely counterproductive to society I don't want to have to pay more taxes to enforce this law Well this gives us an initiative to vote out any congress member that says yes to this bill Go to opencongress org and look up this bill Look at the money trail tab Look at the sheer amount of corporations that support Sgt8 I wonder why They had better kill this bill,,13 năm trước
43,one thing I'm wondering what if its just people from different countries uploading gameplay footage? our government wouldn't have any control over that would they?,,13 năm trước
44,Why isnt Youtube concerned about this? No gameplay no music videos no movie trailers YT would be dead,,12 năm trước
45,Breakdown of bill First line of Sgt8 a Amendments to Section 2319 of Title 18 Section 2319 of title 18 United States Code is amended Opening line of 2319 b b Any person who commits an offense under section 506 alA of title 17 506 alA 1 In general Any person who willfully infringes a copyright shall be punished as provided under section 2319 of title 18 if the infringement was committed A for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain,,12 năm trước

48,TheRealSSBB6a And in recent years I don't blame him people are constantly out to ruin this guys life To say its fair because he told some kid on the internet to fuck off is justifiable its not You don't have to like Phil but at least show the guy a little empathy I mean for crying out loud its the internet man A lot of people say and do whatever they want he wants to be an asshole to people its his right He is the King of Hate after all or at least that is a moniker he goes by or use to I'm sure Phil isn't that bad of a guy he has his flaws but who doesn't,,8 năm trước

55,FireNinja6o6 And don't call me Mr Dunkey that's my father's name please,,9 năm trước
56,Dunkey LongLostSon Okay maybe you do have some taste in gaming since you don't seem to be a fan of modern firstperson shooters But how does Chuggaaconroy suck? Just because he plays Nintendo games?,,9 năm trước
57,FireNinja6o6 I don't even know the dude xD I was just fucking with you,,9 năm trước
58,Dunkey LongLostSon Yeah He's the definition of a scrub,,9 năm trước
59,FireNinja6o6 Had this bill been voted on and passed Chuggaaconroy wouldn't be able to stream gameplay because it would violate US copyright laws This was a video to raise awareness it wasn't meant to be focused on DSP,,9 năm trước
60,boogie2g88 is biased Ghost Banned x2 I don't care if this video was meant to be an accurate premonition of the future that would greatly affect society's well being The fact is he still got over 23000 likes on a video before and I don't think he deserved that at all on any video he puts out considering he's done so much idiotic choices in the past and has said some of the most stupid arguments and opinions I've seen a human being say along with him being unfunny and terrible at video games That's like giving fame and wealth to an adult with an IQ less than an average child's one Thank goodness he hasn't garnered this much likes on a video before But whatever it's just my opinion You don't have to agree with me,,9 năm trước
61,FireNinja6o6 This video came out back before people found him insufferable He probably doesn't deserve the likes but they don't have much meaning,,9 năm trước
62,boogie2g88 is biased Ghost Banned x2 True he wasn't that bad until his Metal Gear Solid 2 Let's Play And I shouldn't care that much about likes on people's videos anyway,,9 năm trước
63,FireNinja6o6 Yeah he's really gone to shit He was alright back then but then again we didn't have that many options when it came to gameplay playthroughs,,9 năm trước
64,I thought Machinima had the permission of the video game companies already,,13 năm trước
65,It would also greatly effect LARGE businesses like Google who depend on videos like this to present adserts on without actually having to create the video's themselves Finding another 'legal' media set of videos like these that people would actually want to 'view' would be kind of difficult because lets face it who wants to see Little Billies Baseball Game on Youtube?,,12 năm trước
66,If they pass this bill it will be end of ALL OF US!!!,,12 năm trước

70,This was back when Ga Comcast's classic video gameHappy Tree Friends etc channel was still in operation And I used to watch HTF after Walmart trips with my late mom I was watching PBSfanatic's PBS Kids before trips I also got into Cars 2 and Lion King as well as the end of Discovery Kids AND ABC Kids by then Plus I watched a lot of Fairly OddParents TV spoofs Max Ruby and insurance ads,,1 năm trước
71,I'm pretty sure there are things more important than this going on in the world that the government needs to worry about,,12 năm trước
72,This would get so many people arrested most of them under 18,,12 năm trước
73,They would likely put in the terms of service that you're allowed to stream their gameplay,,12 năm trước
74,According to the Congressmen who proposed this anything that was previously legal won't be made illegal so according to them video game streaming won't be illegal However making copyright streaming a felony seems a bit drastic to me and I'd almost consider it draconian in nature A felony in the US means quite a lengthy amount of jail time and a hefty fine even in the best of cases and I think this is just too much for simple online piracy especially when you can just remove the content,,13 năm trước
75,passing this bill will mean no more youtube,,13 năm trước
76,Very interesting can I ask how this would affect things such as Gmod videos and other videos created using video game characters and settings?,,12 năm trước
77,If I'm in Canada and do streaming of video games playthroughs walkthrough etc and if this bill is passed would this effect someone that is outside of the US?,,13 năm trước
78,They should wait with this bill until there will be politicians who actually know about games All the old guys should be retired,,13 năm trước
79,To be honest I dont understand WHY the people get mad if copyrighted stuff is on youtube or something else 1 People enjoy watching it It would probably make them go hey this is awesome I'll probably go buy it Its doesn't hurt anything just as long as they give CREDIT to the rightful owners 2 Because of seeing some good footage of it it will tell people if it sucks or if its great WHY DOES COMMON SENSE NEVER OCCUR TO PEOPLE,,12 năm trước
80,If this bill passes Justin Bieber could end up going to jail for 5 years Sigh I guess we can't have the best of both worlds,,12 năm trước
81,Bill Sgt8 will not stop anything if the bill passes I suspect many game companies including us will add a special clause to the TOS specifically to allow posting videos of their games Notch and just think about this it makes sensemost videos games devs want youtubes advertising power,,13 năm trước
82,yeah same question as the guy below me its november whats going with this bill now?,,12 năm trước
83,no need to worry the bill has been abandoned,,12 năm trước
84,And if video game companies are worried about game playthroughs ruining their businesses then a few words Don't make crap games,,12 năm trước
85,If Hollywoodmusicians is scared about loosing money becasue people post their things on the Internet why don't THEY post their own stuff on Youtube and profit with the advertisements? It's common sense Maybe videogame companies should get 12 from the adsense profit Same with the musicians Problem solved! No one gets hurt Everybody getting money Everybody feel warm happiness in their heart End of the story,,13 năm trước
86,Certain games are protected from this under Microsoft's Gaming Content Usage Rules like Halo Fable and Age of Empires These rules grant permission to all gamers to use their game for video purposes and such If this does pass I bet most game studios will immediately release similar rules to cover games like CoD Minecraft ext,,13 năm trước
87,The bill is a violation of a law that's already been issued for multiple years And that law states that nothing can by uploaded that's copyright without educational value or entertainment so everything he says above about the transformative work that we create making gameplay into commentary is forming it into what gamers see as thing with educational gameplay such as how to videos on like WOW black ops etc,,13 năm trước
88,It looks like you have never used a camera There is a feature where you can set it to start on its own so you can get into position,,12 năm trước
89,@NintendoVeteran8s that would happen but the bill already exist for a long time now and it's only being made to be a little more strict,,13 năm trước
90,Now with the Del Facto laws or after the fact laws Youtube Videos of footage before hand would not be forced to be shutdown,,11 năm trước
91,If this law happen tons of people will go to JAIL ALREADY,,13 năm trước
92,@TravelingPigeon In a way Yes Because all of youtubes servers are hosted in the US So even if you do live in another country youtube won't accept it because then youtube would be violating the bill Which means if people want to upload gaming footage A new video hosting site will have to be made outside the US,,13 năm trước
93,I am definately going to spread this around It will be heard throughout my school I will make sure of that Me and lots of other people would be shut down I don't want that Red VS Blue and a lot of other shows that I like would disappear Thumbs Up If you agree!!! D,,12 năm trước
94,This makes sense because if these coorperations really liked all the advertisement then they would give out permission to use their product to stream,,12 năm trước
95,Congress is considering passing a bill that could shut down gaming videos and streams It's called Bill Sgt8 This bill would shut down nova channel and channels like Rooster teeth machinima and other gaming channels all over the internet would be shut down Please research more information about this bill because i can't type it all I never say this in the comments but please thumb this up so people see and copy and paste to other vids like these onto other vids,,13 năm trước
96,Has anyone heard anything about Sgt8? I have been looking and I cant find a thing on it since it got put on the backburner a couple months or so ago,,12 năm trước
97,Question according to this bill if I used photoshop to draw a picture and i created a video tutorial out of that isn't this a public performance of copyrighted material? and how is that different from recording game footage?,,12 năm trước

109,Did any one else know that anonymous group is taking action against this bill,,13 năm trước
110,If anything punishment shouldn't count unless people do things after the bill is released So if the bill happens in 2013 but someone did a vid in 2011 the 2011 vid shouldn't count Cuase at the time it was legal It's not like the government has a time machine that in their current time it's illega so they go back in the past and arrest the person That's ridiculous If anything the crimes that were done before the bill should be pardoned or people should take them down,,12 năm trước
111,I'm often searching for the games on Youtube checking out some gameplay and so on to see if its my type of game It would be sad if the bill would remove gameplays and streams from Youtube,,13 năm trước

122,so its not going to happen? Ever? Please tell me i have just found out about this in the video and im scared,,12 năm trước
123,Yeah I don't think this bill will affect games like cod or forza or fifa considering you're allowed to upload content directly from your console to the internet Moreover these video game companies want their games getting on YT because it's free advertising cod is huge because of YT Additionally YT itself wants these videos because it adds to their revenue w all the advertising think about all the video game ads you see before YT videos Honestly I wouldn't worry about this bill,,13 năm trước
124,@mkaatr you mean Photoshop being copyrighted or your drawing?,,12 năm trước
125,okay one thing i know is that you can upload footage of cod cause they allow ou to in theater modebut what about whiteboy or xjawz ordspgaming they still upload more than cod and i donkt understand if you can or not but if you add commentary are you allowed or notand dsp uploads all the games so i dont know about this id liketo know if anyone can tell me what you can do thanks,,12 năm trước

130,Guys dont worry! video game companies love the way people showcase and provide public attention towards their video games like the way we currently do using sites such as youtube So even if this bill passed the companies would most likely make changes regarding their legal department allowing people to continue uploading videos and if that was impossible to do they would just make no effort to enforce punishment on people Also im in canada so weeo! heellooooo viewers,,13 năm trước
131,That means that gamestop can't preview trailers of the games,,13 năm trước

134,@TheLahness Yes but as Phil said they're adding new additions to the list If it get's too powerful it might include more nations Really there's only a few countries that a company can run succesfully in USA UK Pretty much all of the UK Australia Canada And I can't think of anymore but there's probably a few more,,13 năm trước
135,Here's the plan guys if they pass this bill we all move to Canada,,12 năm trước
136,I don't care if it passes I will still continue to post gameplay videos It's my right as an American and I don't care what bill passes I already have a bill it's called the Bill of Rights,,12 năm trước
137,my question is how many ppl went to the site,,13 năm trước
138,Pay attention children The creators of this bill have stated that this bill is not intended for sites like Youtube but rather sites that profit from uploading copyrighted material This video is great but the topic is getting blown out of proportion Besides it's already illeagle to upload copyrighted material to the internet This will all blow over even if it is passed It's not like people on the internet follow the law as it is!,,13 năm trước
139,I think it's very unlikely that it would pass,,12 năm trước
140,@ShinRyizen I agree the bill as it is infringes on the rights of your people it also infringes on the rights of my country as well as it will effect things like youtube and then out freedom of artistic right will be stopped in some cases as youtube is in the US I think that this bill should have the only effects our citizens this could be considered an infringement on the basic rights of another nation,,13 năm trước
141,I hope supreme court shreds that bill with the first amendment! Freedom of Expression This will kill the internet and destroy internet profits! Users who rely on youtube for profit will lose money!,,13 năm trước
142,Will this just effect America or will foreign countries also not be able to post videos of games??,,13 năm trước

148,If this happenwethe gamer community will unite for our unique rebellionScrew jail and stuff we are not gonna back offWho the hell is with me people?,,13 năm trước
149,I suspect the reason is to get compensated for royalties which they cannot account for from youtube videos containing copyrighted works Unless they figured out a way for that already but either way its about money and theyll goto war for it,,12 năm trước
150,if that damned bill gets passed lots of the gamers in the US will revolt,,13 năm trước
151,is that a statue of Marcus Fenix holding a Boomshot?,,13 năm trước
152,Right now gameplay videos etc are like advertising It's true it actually helps companies It's the piracy that makes the companies lose money since for every gamemovie etc downloaded that usually means one less sale for them In the end I think this is just a further effort to stop piracy since they have failed to stop it and have run out of ideas At least this is from what I've understood so far,,12 năm trước

165,I agree with the bill Streams video clips and playthroughs cause a loss of profit for video game companies The only acceptable form of games shown online for free should be free trailers You want to watch a movie or a game? Then you should have to buy it There is no debating this Guys like DSP are the ones ruining it for others He is not the one stealing its all his youtube followers,,13 năm trước
166,So by their logic I can copyright standing in front of a camera and sue anyone who posts a video of a person standing in front of a camera?

206,DO NOT SUPPORT THIS BILL! It is the first trap in controlling the usage of said copyrighted works This is a trap and the sole purpose is to generate or attempt to gain loss of profit that they claim to should have received In other words this is the first step to monetizing public viewings and performances Imagine game review sites such as Gamespot IGN Gametrailers and even Gamestop They would be forced to pay to review their games because they are essentially sampling their work,,12 năm trước

213,THUMB THIS UP SO EVERYBODY CAN SEE IT the bill sgt8 wont change shit its already illegal to post gaming videos without the permission from the developers of the game but the fact is that most developers like that you post videos about their game like in black ops you have theater mode sou can share clips and upload to youtube and when bill sgt8 comes out if it passes its still uåp to the developers of the game to remove content on youtube so just relax,,13 năm trước
214,@flyhiga No but I bet that there is a very large amount of people who watch movie trailers on YT that they wouldn't have seen if it wasn't on YT Also there is a big review community that tells you which movies are worth to see and which movies isn't YT helps the sales and popularity of videogames movies etc more most people think,,13 năm trước
215,If the bill passes and they lied and it will actually affect youtube or video game footage machinima youtube etc wont go out of business The United States does not get full control of the internet Besides how many people do you think will play along and go through the hassle of attacking things like this?

243,@KyrkRTG Basically this means that you won't go to jail if you post a video with copyrighted content unless you're doing it for your profit People with Youtube partnerships will have to ask for copyright permission before posting videos like that again Also since Bieber didn't have a partnership when he was posting his old videos meaning no profit he won't be going to jail if it passes happy Beliebers?,,12 năm trước
