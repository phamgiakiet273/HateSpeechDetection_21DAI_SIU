one gests to be here i'm just dickin around i want to get my drink in the camera startalreadybut anyway really important this video i whether you're a fan or not of meif
if i might holdin iss
if you are at all
a fan of seeing foodage of video games on the internet of any sort whith they weretalking video clips
video clips of play-througs whether we're talking live streaming platers streaming of tournaments like streetfighter tournaments starcraft tournaments lduty tournaments m
coverage of e-three video of janes ind e-three that's just going over the internet
there is a bill that was created that is currently being debated on by congress thares against its up for approval orwhatever and possibly will be signed into law
in this bill the bill is s period nine-seven
herese with the intent of the bil-ness the bill is intending that they don't wowt people streaming tibe movies that kind of copyrighting content over the internet because
hollywood and the snil these studios are worried about it they worry that their losing profets with his people are duin
doing this kind of stuff over the internet nowthe goal of the bill isnot only make it illegal but to have very serious legal consequences for isnumber one you could possibly have massive civil finds which were talking thousands opon thousands of dollars and number two you could actually go to jail for this bubelieved upto five years you can go to jail for doing it
i can understand
where they're coming from there with movies antv and that kind of media that is is not changing its not a changing interactive media
whet i dil understand is that this bill if it goes through the wae worded right-now will actually also apply to video games because video games are considered copyrightend works nazovright now it's perfectly legal to streantournament footage of a video game to stream a playthoroviberiam or to oblo videos of a video game and especially with live commentary for doing commentary on jebasically
making it a transformative work which makes it completely legalyoure doing your own commentary criticism you're turning into a transformed work
other people have also made the argument that just gameplay of video games is completely legal to foot on internet because just the act of you picking up the controller
an actually interacting with the game creates something that's far different an just watching a stagnat movier tv show that ever changes this your interaction with the game creates a transformative workowthe problem is the way the billa's worded says that copyrighted works cannot be publicly displayed or performed withouthe permission of the copyright holder so essentially what this means is if i wante to a play through of
my war fayr three and im gan nthrogh the campaign i need to get exclusive permission from
activision-infinity r whoer you wantsayhe copyright holder of the game todo that and not only interest the campaign but the multiplayers i want ta record a match of you playin togan multiplayer put on the internet i' havgo und of my way to get exclusive permission from this company ake a wild-guest if ior email actdivision if they're ever gonta email me back andtell me if i gedov permission to do a play throughout their gamei'm just never gonto get a response because they're big company they don't care about that kind osufftheyre worried about developing gamesnow
here's the set okay
because it's worded incorrectly this bill if it does go into law you're talking literally entire businesses wi'll go out of business mchinema for one m
any other company that puts this kind of footage on te internet half of yutubes going  have to be taken downnto be an insane amount of work to take down all these video game footage video you now whaanyone who has partnership with theseplate things h's gonta be taken it's just s ridiculous it's absolutely ridiculous noi believe that the lawo the way that works ou have to make more than twenty-five hundred dollars in a year
arm
in order to illegally liable and also you need to have ten ten strikes meaning i could upload nine videos of video game footage and i'm fine
as long as someone asked me to take it down i take it oun but if i opelowed a tens that's itbroken the law and i can either get master fines or i could go tochailno
first of all i'm not beingan alarm ist here  saying ohoh my god the house's burning downis the end of  internet as we know oka but
there's a couple thinks first of all this bill is very early its just got introduced i believe in may and it jus just talked about it for the first time on june twentieth soit's not
it's not close to being passed yet eh
the thing is a lot of major media allids like tollywood are really pushing hard to get this bill pasti have n
i have no problem with the bill if they were amended to make plucking sense the problem is a lot of our lawmakers are out of touch with reality out-of touch with how the internet really works what's actually onplaces like you to and there just us listening to the lobbyests who are talking into their ears saying gatepatis bill whose people are downloading movies anan it's not fair and ea makeses t wich aveable to steal o broadcasting vertov over the nternet bus just pass the bill and heyre not understanding the recussions of the bill on other forms of media primarily video games inparticularso talking just about me i'm saying spukiguys on he west coastapologize as i forgot teir name that they-stream stream fight retournaments anyone who streams any gaming whatsoever will be shut down i'll be shut down anyone who puts gaming footoge will be shut down and so now geswols can happen workin to go back to dark ages before the internet where you don't know ifthe games good or not because you can't actually see footage of ityou can't actually get an honest review ofi
icompletely flipped on his head is all is freedom of information that ev ha olis tectechnological advances that weve had is gonna go awaybut it doesn't only apply to video games think about this there's alot of people who on youto have actually made it big singing kerioke justin bever was one of im just in beaver a couple other people of achigatan signe because they were playing soeother artist sand they sang itand they made it big anotergoegues whatthis makes that illegal too you can't do that because that's copyrighted music and you can't put that on the internet how dr you sing ocarioke song on the internet that's gonta make it illegal to that's how absurd this abillitness in its current form andits its ludicrous allot of people are buzzing about this ultra david from the sarca community overunabut a large article aboutanasa lawyer so he knows istuff and  very ey concern that he's like howcan lawmakers
try to pass a bill without understanding the entire situation of what it il actually affect in its curform through being very lazy basically antheire being very unprofessional in their jobs ad teire basically risking business the risking big business i mean there's a lot of people who are making money off this kind of thigand there's nothing wrong witht actually promotes for example the video games music or whatever it is that being used again being used properly i do not in any way condoned just uploading of v show or uploading or streaming a movie over the uternet for freeantpeople sically stealing an dax nopright t i completely  incorrect you should not be able to o but a ieogame play-through promotsyour game shows people enjoying the game shows people with the games like makes tho want to go-off and byit it's a nobrainer that this stuff is somekind of thing thas hurting business is actually helping business adgovernment is not understanding this because again t jus how these wondruple-oous whispering in their er andtheyre notthinking it through
thether this might never een get pase because traditionally what happens in our us government i don't no y novellize international fans i just saw in my latest ask te king episode that forty-five percent of my viewers are actually international which huge ven know thatbutin the us government when typically happens as when they tredito billpass all of a sudden someonels tried to ack something else onothe bill so you'll have a built for this like this andthetill say yebwe have to make sure that in indiana it's illegal to fuk coats because tere was a guylisefi datfuk to o and we got stock those dirty goltfunkers so werer toput an amendment on the bill that is an indiana it's illegal to funkl goansometimes yo just
whattefunct does ot have to do with the bill at handand they do alot of times these bills cause they triso much done at want the'll put forty things on the bill and only two of overly are related and the restoo bunch a shipis what happens in the inarlegal e not arlel systemar government is the great governmentso anywaythat might hold up anykind of decision that would be made about this bill
arm
i really don't forsee that the bill its pass anytime soon traditionally these hendetings take a while there gonna argue on each side there en a halsh-out the builder and try to change it a little bit
what i'm really am hoping is that people hear people like meexplaining to the overnalisn this is not right what you're doing is a blanket law that'is actually going to hinder business
and
basically shut down freedom of information on the internet youare basically going to go back to thedark ages before the internet existed because you're making a law that's wereinto bennefit a very few little smallbusinesses that were rnamic movies and films and you're fucting over a completely new industry that was created by the internetsoyet have to think before you ac youhave to think before you passe this bill it needs to be amended or changed before its passe in its current form
nowwhal can youas an individual if you are ufcitizenyou have the right to help oyou can write your congress person plainidon't believe that this bill is correct in its current form imnot that i-supporting piracy or anything like anyway butis going to negatively affect lots of different things that have happened people will be lissing karioki songs on unternet anymore people wvr be able o overview of a video game feowil will be able to do so many things thathave helped business ay
and you can write youre congressmen or wha i'm goingtodo link in this videowhere you can go and you can actually straight from there put in your personal information and send it offcnsend automatically to certain places in the government certain congress people and people who ware trying to push for this bill adyou can write your own messagers already look at the full messanger saying i don't support the bill or you coand write your own arants say listenyou nothiis not right it makes no-sense in its current form you're actually going to hurt things that you don't understand your hurting because you don't know enough about this you'are not educated enough about the subject to pass this bill as it is
soain just ryr fantomine rtand that's why your doing it but thiis an important issue if you have friends wven fantomined witto know shownist video we need to get topic out there now whild fresh while its new whileliterally just happening nowdon't let it wait six months and  the end of the year guess what guys were passing the bill and then for six months no one can put stofanero because the government completely flucked up andhen of course it'll probably get overturned but it will take forever to get overturn itsul be another eurolegal battle
i can imagine i cannot imagine
them actually censoring the internet like this but tiis what they're looking othere actuly locompletely sensor things on the internet which is so ridiculous shdoesn't belong i meansing again people should be steeling and uploading movies of videos butwhen you buy a video game you are purchasing a license
play a piece of softwareyou're not purchasing the software so if you're uploading the actual gamefiles internetyou deserve tbut if you're just playing the game and ou record your interactive experienced with that gameyoure input created at experience that is atransformative workis protected under you as copyright lawthe problem is noone's talking about hs right nowereally icongress understanding thatand the way the laws furtright out it will not protect at anymore an people runaait screcompanies are gon against internets nat rwowe needreally has a community talk about his get to  discussion goingtell your parents about it till your friends aboutit till your family aboutit everyone involved ins d wehalf te allcollectivelyspeak weont if we just sit here and were lazy andnevey complecent let iloeythiis howf dohho goes wrong in our government people just beakn sitting youre complecentanspeaking up and not trying to take a severyon eeds to doif you're m this kind of stop you need to speak up if you don't wothe unternet to be completely  sensored like this you need to speak do omeing link this video you can do something you can personally contact your own congressmen
and talk about it but it needs to be brought up and it needs to be understood i just i dot
feel negatively abow
the senate or the congressary in ol vokers voting on the bill i don't feel negatively about them i justhink they're misinform i think that their intentions are in the right place they don't want people stealing tevian movies and uploading into the internatworal streaming and for free over the internet that's not right but at the flipsite of it they need to understand that repercussions of their actions for passing the billanan's current form are going to negatively hurt
information business its going to be a disaster so please
ease pleadings speak up
say somethingtelefron tlrelative spread the word get everyone talking about this and get them to go and talk to their c u hdon't fuis not we need tstand right now and saydisbild needs to be amended so make sense for what you're really trying to do because not all copyrighted works or what you're thia lot of variation in what a copyrighted works is not all just an unchanging tv show there' things that are completely differentyouno nos really copyrighted in a video game the software itself not te experience so when you say ok a public display of a copyrighted workthe public display would be if iturned on of computer monitor haecoding for the gameactual coding lines of the game if i publicly displayed that would be a violation of this law but would heire not understanding is that
the situation where if you're playing again actual broadcast of that is a transformative workhis needs tobe fleshed out for e logets past irls belont people orgun against
sorry to be like alarmis buti'm not a washdog or anything like that bu gs couple messages about this already an themore i look into it then i read ultradavidsarle anunliketiis uthiis our time as americans to exercise our right to speak to our governmet an say absolutely this owthat we want and by the way it's not fair it's can be harmful to business thats can be harmful to a lot of different things andyou're not doing what you're intending woith this law on its current form
all right that's it again please please i'm very serious about this you haf to tell people get peoble to-watch this video get people talking about the subject get people to write use the linktal oever you need to and your own government in
let's si let's get this awareness outdear and let's make this happen right thanks allot
