9,Instead of getting this country out of debt our Government is banning video games instead?,13 years ago
10,So basically this bill will take away the ability of Game Developers to freely advertise their games via the players Not only will this shut down businesses that revolve around streaming gameplay but will also probably cut down on sales of the video game itself I like many people do n't go out and buy games until I see some gameplay in action,12 years ago
11,Why the heck these old videos keep showing up in my notifications?,7 years ago

18,I looked this up on and it said that the people who are pushing for this bill to be passed said that the bill will only target websites or people who profit from illegally streaming copyrighted material So videogame vids wo n't be affected,13 years ago
19,Wish this bill passed just to get DSP locked up,1 years ago
20,i know right when was famous,5 years ago
21,That's because he actually sounds relatively knowledgeable and polished here with less of his trademark negative behavioral qualities that define his normal video game playthroughs,1 months ago
22,If he had actually acted like he does in this video as opposed to how he normally acts in most of his other videos maybe he wouldn't be as to the same degree that he is now,1 months ago

36,Seriously why does the government focus on less important stuff like the internet instead of other issues? This is not If this bill passes EVERYONE BREAK THE LAW!!!,12 years ago
37,And it has gotten worse The version of the bill does not criminalise the viewing of videos but some analysis of the version of the bill just made public would criminalise viewing The version is so bad that even private streaming just your yourself would be a felony under the house version,12 years ago
38,I agree we should definitely stop this If it passes we must all write letters and emails asking for permission and fill their offices and servers until they get rid of it,12 years ago

56,key LostSon Okay maybe you do have some taste in gaming since you do n't seem to be a fan of modern firstperson shooters But how does ggaaconsuck? Just because he plays games?,9 years ago
57,Fire6o6 I do n't even know the dude xD I was just fucking with you,9 years ago
58,key LostYeah He's the definition of a scrub,9 years ago
59,Fireja6o6 Had this bill been voted on and passed ggaaconwouldn't be able to stream gameplay because it would violate copyright laws This was a video to raise awareness it wasn't meant to be focused on SP,9 years ago
60,boogie2g88 is biased Ghost Banned x2 I do n't care if this video was meant to be an accurate preition of the future that would greatly affect society's well being The fact is he still got over 23000 likes on a video before and I do n't think he deserved that at all on any video he puts out considering he's done so much idiotic choices in the past and has said some of the most stupid arguments and opinions I've seen a human being say along with him being unfunny and terrible at video games That's like giving fame and wealth to an adult with an IQ less than an average child's one Thank goodness he hasn't garnered this much likes on a video before But whatever it's just my opinion You do n't have to agree with me,9 years ago
61,Fire6o6 This video came out back before people found him insufferable He probably doesn't deserve the likes but they do n't have much meaning,9 years ago
62,boo2g88 is biased Banned x2 True he wasn't that bad until his Let's And I shouldn't care that much about likes on people's videos anyway,9 years ago
63,Fire6o6 Yeah he's really gone to shit He was alright back then but then again we did n't have that many options when it came to gameplay playthroughs,9 years ago
64,I thought inima had the permission of the video game companies already,13 years ago
65,It would also greatly effect LARGE businesses like who depend on videos like this to present adserts on without actually having to create the video's themselves Finding another 'legal' media set of videos like these that people would actually want to 'view' would be kind of difficult because lets face it who wants to see Little Game on Youtube?,12 years ago
66,If they pass this bill it will be end of ALL OF US!!!,12 years ago
67,bzol What I am asking is that Is creating video for a copyghted software playing a game or a tutorial for using considered public performance of a copyghted material? I am asking if video tutorials falls into this category as well,12 years ago
68,Government's first duty is to protect the people not run their lives,12 years ago

70,This was back when cast's classic video gameetc channel was still in operation And I used to watch Hafter trips with my late mom I was watching PBSfanatic's before trips I also got into and as well as the end of AND by then Plus I watched a lot of spoofs and insurance ads,1 years ago
71,I'm pretty sure there are things more important than this going on in the world that the needs to worry about,12 years ago
72,This would get so many people arrested most of them under 18,12 years ago
73,They would likely put in the terms of service that you're allowed to stream their gameplay,12 years ago
74,According to the ssmen who proposed this anything that was previously legal wo n't be made illegal so according to them video game streaming wo n't be illegal However making copyright streaming a felony seems a bit drastic to me and I'd almost consider it draconian in nature A felony in the means quite a lengthy amount of jail time and a hefty fine even in the best of cases and I think this is just too much for simple online piracy especially when you can just remove the content,13 years ago
75,passing this bill will mean no more,13 years ago
76,Very interesting can I ask how this would affect things such as Gmod videos and other videos created using video game characters and settings?,12 years ago

78,They should wait with this bill until there will be politicians who actually know about games All the old guys should be retired,13 years ago
79,To be honest I dont understand WHY the people get mad if copyrighted stuff is on or something else 1 People enjoy watching it It would probably make them go hey this is awesome I'll probably go buy it Its doesn't hurt anything just as long as they give CREDIT to the rightful owners 2 Because of seeing some good footage of it it will tell people if it sucks or if its great WHY DOES COMMON SENSE NEVER OCCUR TO PEOPLE,12 years ago
80,If this bill passes could end up going to jail for 5 years Sigh I guess we can't have the best of both worlds,12 years ago
81,gt8 will not stop anything if the bill passes I suspect many game companies including us will add a special clause to the specifically to allow posting videos of their games Notch and just think about this it makes sensemost videos games devs want advertising power,13 years ago
82,yeah same question as the guy below me its november whats going with this bill now?,12 years ago
83,no need to worry the bill has been abandoned,12 years ago
84,And if video game companies are worried about game playthroughs ruining their businesses then a few words Don't make crap games,12 years ago
85,If musicians is scared about loosing money becasue people post their things on the Internet why do n't THEY post their own stuff on and profit with the advertisements? It's common sense Maybe videogame companies should get 12 from the adsense profit Same with the musicians Problem solved! No one gets hurt Everybody getting money Everybody feel warm happiness in their heart End of the story,13 years ago
86,Certain games are protected from this under soft's Gaming Content Usage Rules like Fable and ires These rules grant permission to all gamers to use their game for video purposes and such If this does pass I bet most game studios will immediately release similar rules to cover games like ext,13 years ago
87,The bill is a violation of a law that's already been issued for multiple years And that law states that nothing can by uploaded that's copyright without educational value or entertainment so everything he says above about the transformative work that we create making gameplay into commentary is forming it into what gamers see as thing with educational gameplay such as how to videos on like etc,13 years ago
88,It looks like you have never used a camera There is a feature where you can set it to start on its own so you can get into position,12 years ago
89,NintendoVeteran8s that would happen but the bill already exist for a long time now and it's only being made to be a little more strict,13 years ago
90,Now with the to laws or after the fact laws Videos of footage before hand would not be forced to be shutdown,11 years ago
91,If this law happen tons of people will go to JAIL ALREADY,13 years ago
92,TravelingPigeon In a way Yes Because all of servers are hosted in the So even if you do live in another country wo n't accept it because then would be violating the bill Which means if people want to upload gaming footage A new video hosting site will have to be made outside the,13 years ago
93,I am definately going to spread this around It will be heard throughout my school I will make sure of that Me and lots of other people would be shut down I do n't want that Red VS Blue and a lot of other shows that I like would disappear Thumbs Up If you agree!!! D,12 years ago
94,This makes sense because if these coorperreally liked all the advertisement then they would give out permission to use their product to stream,12 years ago
95,is considering passing a bill that could shut down gaming videos and streams It's called gt8 This bill would shut down channel and channels like ster teeth machinima and other gaming channels all over the internet would be shut down Please research more information about this bill because i can't type it all I never say this in the comments but please thumb this up so people see and copy and paste to other vids like these onto other vids,13 years ago
96,Has anyone heard anything about Sgt8? I have been looking and I cant find a thing on it since it got put on the backburner a couple months or so ago,12 years ago
97,Question according to this bill if I used to draw a picture and i created a video tutorial out of that isn't this a public performance of copyrighted material? and how is that different from recording game footage?,12 years ago
98,what about Copyright Disclaimer Under 107 of allowance is made for fair use for purposes such as criticism comment news reporting teaching scholarship and research Fair use is a use permitted by statute that might otherwise be infringing Nonprofit educational or personal use tips balance in favor of fair use,12 years ago
99,I've signed a petition to this bill and suggest to anybody else who believes that sgt8 is ridiculous should follow the link in the video details and sign Please every signature counts!!,13 years ago

109,Did any one else know that group is taking action against this bill,13 years ago
110,If anything punishment shouldn't count unless people do things after the bill is released So if the bill happens in 2013 but someone did a vid in 2011 the 2011 vid shouldn't count Cuase at the time it was legal It's not like the has a time machine that in their current time it's illega so they go back in the past and arrest the person That's ridiculous If anything the crimes that were done before the bill should be pardoned or people should take them down,12 years ago
111,I'm often searching for the games on checking out some gameplay and so on to see if its my type of game It would be sad if the bill would remove gameplays and streams from,13 years ago

113,imagine how many gamers would be in jail because of this,12 years ago
114,I did an essay about this bill for class and this video really helped me a lot,11 years ago
115,ThundertonTV You are very correct but imagine if does pass it and hackers do nothing Instead of telling people what you are it should be a plan B for us all In mean time we should just sign the petitions and do whatever we can,12 years ago
116,I WILL cry if this bill get passed,13 years ago
117,I started freaking outthen i noticed this was 2 years old lol,11 years ago

122,so its not going to happen? Ever? Please tell me i have just found out about this in the video and im scared,12 years ago
123,Yeah I do n't think this bill will affect games like or forza or considering you're allowed to upload content directly from your console to the internet Moreover these video game companies want their games getting on because it's free advertising is huge because of Additionally itself wants these videos because it adds to their revenue w all the advertising think about all the video game ads you see before videos Honestly I wouldn't worry about this bill,13 years ago
124,mkaatr you mean being copyrighted or your drawing?,12 years ago
125,okay one thing i know is that you can upload footage of cause they allow ou to in theater modebut what about whiteboy or xjawz ordspgaming they still upload more than and i donkt understand if you can or not but if you add commentary are you allowed or notand dsp uploads all the games so i dont know about this id liketo know if anyone can tell me what you can do thanks,12 years ago

129,There is even worse than Sgt8 Proposed changes to the could make such streams illegal even without Sgt8,13 years ago
130,Guys dont worry! video game companies love the way people showcase and provide public attention towards their video games like the way we currently do using sites such as So even if this bill passed the companies would most likely make changes regarding their legal department allowing people to continue uploading videos and if that was impossible to do they would just make no effort to enforce punishment on people Also im in so weeo! heellooooo viewers,13 years ago
131,That means that can't preview trailers of the games,13 years ago
132,they would be biting off WAY more than they can chew if they do n't amend that,12 years ago
133,575 people want this bill to pass,13 years ago
134,TheLahness Yes but as said they're adding new additions to the list If it get's too powerful it might include more nations Really there's only a few countries that a company can run succesfully in Pretty much all of the And I can't think of anymore but there's probably a few more,13 years ago
135,Here's the plan guys if they pass this bill we all move to,12 years ago
136,I do n't care if it passes I will still continue to post gameplay videos It's my right as an and I do n't care what bill passes I already have a bill it's called the,12 years ago
137,my question is how many ppl went to the site,13 years ago
138,Pay attention children The creators of this bill have stated that this bill is not intended for sites like but rather sites that profit from uploading copyghted material This video is great but the topic is getting blown out of proportion Besides it's already illeagle to upload copyghted material to the internet This will all blow over even if it is passed It's not like people on the internet follow the law as it is!,13 years ago
139,I think it's very unlikely that it would pass,12 years ago
140,izen I agree the bill as it is infringes on the rights of your people it also infringes on the rights of my country as well as it will effect things like and then out freedom of artistic right will be stopped in some cases as is in the I think that this bill should have the only effects our citizens this could be considered an infringement on the basic rights of another nation,13 years ago
141,I hope shreds that bill with the first amendment! pression This will kill the internet and destroy internet profits! Users who rely on for profit will lose money!,13 years ago

148,If this happenwethe community will unite for our unique rebellionScrew jail and stuff we are not gonna back offWho the hell is with me people?,13 years ago
149,I suspect the reason is to get compensated for royalties which they cannot account for from videos containing copyrighted works Unless they figured out a way for that already but either way its about money and theyll goto war for it,12 years ago
150,if that damned bill gets passed lots of the gamers in the will revolt,13 years ago
151,is that a statue of holding a Boomshot?,13 years ago
152,Right now gameplay videos etc are like advertising 's true it actually helps companies 's the piracy that makes the companies lose money since for every gamemovie etc downloaded that usually means one less sale for them In the end I think this is just a further effort to stop piracy since they have failed to stop it and have run out of ideas At least this is from what I've understood so far,12 years ago
153,I'm doing a speech about this this week hoping to influence my classmates to not vote on this,12 years ago

165,I agree with the bill Streams video clips and playthroughs cause a loss of profit for video game companies The only acceptable form of games shown online for free should be free trailers You want to watch a movie or a game? Then you should have to buy it There is no debating this Guys like SP are the ones ruining it for others He is not the one stealing its all his followers,13 years ago
166,So by their logic I can copyright standing in front of a camera and sue anyone who posts a video of a person standing in front of a camera? I should copyright a vid of meeting so every time they meet I can make money off the tv news stations What will they think of next a law against crossing the street?,12 years ago
