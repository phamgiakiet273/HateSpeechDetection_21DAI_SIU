1,all right that's it again please please i'm very serious about this you haf to tell people get peoble to-watch this video get people talking about the subject get people to write use the linktal oever you need to and your own government in,
2,let's si let's get this awareness outdear and let's make this happen right thanks allot,
3,i can understand,
4,where they're coming from there with movies antv and that kind of media that is is not changing its not a changing interactive media,
5,whet i dil understand is that this bill if it goes through the wave worded right-now will actually also apply to video games because video games are considered copyrightend works nazovright now it's perfectly legal to streantournament footage of a video game to stream a playiam or to blo videos of a video game and especially with live commentary for doing commentary on asically,
6,making it a transformative work which makes it completely legalyoure doing your own commentary criticism you're turning into a transformed work,
7,other people have also made the argument that just gameplay of video games is completely legal to foot on internet because just the act of you picking up the controller,
8,an actually interacting with the game creates something that's far different an just watching a stagmovier tv show that ever changes this your interaction with the game creates a transformative workowthe problem is the way the billa's worded says that copyghted works cannot be publicly displayed or performed withouthe permission of the copyright holder so essentially what this means is if i wante to a play through of,
9,if i might holdin iss,
10,my war fayr three and im nthrothe campaign i need to get exclusive permission from,
11,activision-infinity r whoer you wantsayhe copyright holder of the game todo that and not only interest the campaign but the multiplayers i want ta record a match of you playin togan multiplayer put on the internet i' go und of my way to get exclusive permission from this company ake a d-guest if ior email actdivision if they're ever gonta email me back andtell me if i gedov permission to do a play throughout their gamei'm just never gonto get a response because they're big company they do n't care about that kind osufftheyre worried about developing gamesnow,
12,if you are at all,
13,here's the set okay,
14,because it's worded incorrectly this bill if it does go into law you're talking literally entire businesses wi'll go out of business mchinfor one m,
15,a fan of seeing foodage of video games on the internet of any sort whith they weretalking video clips,
16,any other company that puts this kind of footage on te internet half of yutubes going have to be taken downnto be an insane amount of work to take down all these video game footage video you now whaanyone who has partnership with theseplate things h's gonta be taken it's just s ridiculous it's absolutely ridiculous noi believe that the lawo the way that works ou have to make more than twenty-five hundred dollars in a year,
17,arm,
18,in order to illegally liable and also you need to have ten ten strikes meaning i could upload nine videos of video game footage and i'm fine,
19,as long as someone asked me to take it down i take it oun but if i opelowed a tens that's itbroken the law and i can either get master fines or i could go tochailno,
20,first of all i'm not beingan alarm ist here saying ohoh my god the house's burning downis the end of internet as we know oka but,
21,there's a couple thinks first of all this bill is very early its just got introduced i believe in may and it jus just talked about it for the first time on june twentieth soit's not,
22,video clips of play-througs whether we're talking live streaming platers streaming of tournaments like streettournaments starcraft tournaments lduty tournaments m,
23,it's not close to being passed yet eh,
24,the thing is a lot of major media allids like tolare really pushing hard to get this bill pasti have n,
25,i have no problem with the if they were amended to make plucking sense the problem is a lot of our lawmakers are out of touch with reality out-of touch with how the internet really works what's actually onplaces like you to and there just us listening to the lobbyests who are talking into their ears saying epatis whose people are downloading movies anan it's not fair and ea makeses t wich aveable to steal o broadcasting verover the nnet bus just pass the and heyre not understanding the recussions of the on other forms of media primarily video games inparticularso talking just about me i'm saying spukiguys on he west coastapologize as i forgot teir name that they-stream stream fight retournaments anyone who streams any gaming whatsoever will be shut down i'll be shut down anyone who puts gaming footoge will be shut down and so now geswols can happen workin to go back to dark ages before the internet where you do n't know ifthe games good or not because you can't actually see footage of ityou can't actually get an honest review ofi,
26,icompletely flipped on his head is all is freedom of information that ha olis tectechnological advances that weve had is gonna go awaybut it doesn't only apply to video games think about this there's alot of people who on youto have actually made it big singing oke ver was one of im just in a couple other people of achigsignbecause they were playing soother artist sand they sang itand they made it big anotergogues whatthis makes that illegal too you can't do that because that's copyrighted music and you can't put that on the internet how dr you sing ocarioke song on the internet that's gonta make it illegal to that's how absurd this abillitness in its current form andits its ludicrous allot of people are buzzing about this ultra david from the sarca community overunabut a large article aboutanasa lawyer so he knows istuff and very ey concern that he's like howcan lawmakers,
27,try to pass a bill without understanding the entire situation of what it il actually affect in its curform through being very lazy basically anthebeing very unprofessional in their jobs ad tebasically risking business the risking big business i mean there's a lot of people who are making money off this kind of thigand there's nothing wrong witht actually promotes for example the video games music or whatever it is that being used again being used properly i do not in any way condoned just uploading of v show or uploading or streaming a movie over the uternet for freeantpeople sically stealing an dax nopright t i completely incorrect you should not be able to o but a ieogame play-through promotsyour game shows people enjoying the game shows people with the games like makes tho want to go-off and byit it's a nobrainer that this stuff is somekind of thing thas hurting business is actually helping business adgovernment is not understanding this because again t jus how these wondruple-oous whispering in their er andtheyre notthinking it through,
28,coverage of e-three video of es ind e-three that's just going over the internet,
29,thether this might never een get pase because traditionally what happens in our i do n't no y novellize international fans i just saw in my latest ask te episode that forty-five percent of my viewers are actually international which huge ven know thattin the when typically happens as when they tredito pass all of a sudden someontried to ack something else onothe so you'll have a built for this like this andthetill say yebwe have to make sure that in indiana it's illegal to fuk coats because tere was a guylisefi datfuk to o and we got stock those dirty goltfunkers so werer toput an amendment on the that is an indiana it's illegal to funkl goansometimes yo just,
30,there is a bill that was created that is currently being debated on by thares against its up for approval orwhatever and possibly will be signed into law,
31,whattefunct does ot have to do with the bill at handand they do alot of times these bills cause they tryso much done at want the'll put forty things on the bill and only two of overly are related and the restoo bunch a shipis what happens in the inlegal e not government is the great governmentso anywaythat might hold up anykind of decision that would be made about this bill,
32,arm,
33,i really do n't forsee that the bill its pass anytime soon traditionally these hendetings take a while there gonna argue on each side there en a halsh-out the builder and try to change it a little bit,
34,what i'm really am hoping is that people hear people like meexplaining to the overnalisn this is not right what you're doing is a blanket law that'is actually going to hinder business,
35,one gests to be here i'm just dickin around i want to get my drink in the camera startalreadybut anyway really important this video i whether you're a fan or not of meif,
36,and,
37,basically shut down freedom of information on the youare basically going to go back to thedark ages before the existed because you're making a law that's wereinto fit a very few little smallbusinesses that were rnamic movies and films and you're fucting over a completely new industry that was created by the internetsoyet have to think before you ac youhave to think before you passe this bill it needs to be amended or changed before its passe in its current form,
38,nowwhal can youas an individual if you are ufcitizenyou have the right to help oyou can write your person plainidon't believe that this bill is correct in its current form imnot that i-supporting piracy or anything like anyway butis going to negatively affect lots of different things that have happened people will be lissing karioki songs on unternet anymore people wvr be able o overview of a video game feowil will be able to do so many things thathave helped business ay,
39,in this bill the bill is s period nine-seven,
40,and you can write youre congressmen or wha i'm goingtodo link in this videowhere you can go and you can actually straight from there put in your personal information and send it offcnsend automatically to certain places in the certain people and people who ware trying to push for this bill adyou can write your own messagers already look at the full messanger saying i do n't support the bill or you coand write your own arsay listenyou nois not right it makes no-sense in its current form you're actually going to hurt things that you do n't understand your hurting because you do n't know enough about this you'are not educated enough about the subject to pass this bill as it is,
41,herese with the intent of the bil-ness the bill is intending that they do n't wowt people streaming tibe movies that kind of copyrighting content over the internet because,
42,sojust ryr fanrtand that's why your doing it but thiis an important issue if you have friends wfanwitto know showvideo we need to get topic out there now whfresh while its new whiliterjust happening nowdo n't let it wait six months and the end of the year guess what guys were passing the bill and then for six months no one can put stofanero because the government completely flucked up andhen of course it'll probably get overturned but it will take forever to get overturn itsul be another eurolegal battle,
43,i can imagine i cannot imagine,
44,them actually censoring the internet like this but is what they're looking othere actuly locompletely sensor things on the internet which is so ridiculous shdoesn't belong i meansing again people should be steeling and uploading movies of videos butwhen you buy a video game you are purchasing a license,
45,play a piece of softwareyou're not purchasing the software so if you're uploading the actual gamefiles internetyou deserve tbut if you're just playing the game and ou record your interactive experienced with that gameyoure input created at experience that is atransformative workis protected under you as copyright lawthe problem is noone's talking about hs right noweally icongress understanding thatand the way the laws furtright out it will not protect at anymore an people runaait screcompanies are gon against internets nat rwowe needreally has a community talk about his get to discussion goingtell your parents about it till your friends aboutit till your family aboutit everyone involved ins d wehalf te allcollectivelyspeak weont if we just sit here and were lazy andnevey complecent let iloeythiis howf dohho goes wrong in our government people just beakn sitting youre complecentanspeaking up and not trying to take a severyon eeds to doif you're m this kind of stop you need to speak up if you do n't wothe unternet to be completely sensored like this you need to speak do omeing link this video you can do something you can personally contact your own congressmen,
46,and the snil these studios are worried about it they worry that their losing prots with his people are duin,
47,and talk about it but it needs to be brought up and it needs to be understood i just i dot,
48,feel negatively abow,
49,the or the congressin ol vovoting on the bill i do n't feel negatively about them i justhink they're misinform i think that their intentions are in the right place they do n't want people stealing tmovies and uploading into the interworstreaming and for free over the internet that's not right but at the flipsite of it they need to understand that repercussions of their actions for passing the bill's current form are going to negatively hurt,
50,doing this kind of stuff over the internet nowthe goal of the bill not only make it illegal but to have very serious legal consequences for number one you could possibly have massive civil finds which were talking thousands opon thousands of dollars and number two you could actually go to jail for this bubelieved upto five years you can go to jail for doing it,
51,information business its going to be a disaster so please,
52,ease pleadings speak up,
53,say somethingtelefron tlrelative spread the word get everyone talking about this and get them to go and talk to their c u hdo n't fuis not we need tstand right now and saydisbild needs to be amended so make sense for what you're really trying to do because not all copyghted or what you're thia lot of variation in what a copyghted is not all just an unchanging tv show there' things that are completely differentyouno nos really copyghted in a video game the software itself not te experience so when you say ok a public display of a copyghted workthe public display would be if iturned on of computer monitor haecoding for the gameactual coding lines of the game if i publicly displayed that would be a violation of this law but would heire not understanding is that,
54,the situation where if you're playing again actual broadcast of that is a transformative workhis needs tobe fleshed out for logets past irls belont people orgun against,
55,sorry to be like alarmis bu'm not a washdog or anything like that bu gs couple messages about this already themore i look into it then i read ultrale unlikeis uis our time as to exercise our right to speak to our governmet say absolutely this owthat we want and by the way it's not fair it's can be harmful to business thats can be harmful to a lot of different things andyou're not doing what you're intending woith this law on its current form,
