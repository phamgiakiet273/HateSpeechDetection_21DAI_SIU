18,I did a little Research and found that 2 of the Politicians behind the bill statet that the bill does NOT affect the Gaming Vids Additionally it was said that only commercial streaming is issued So dont panic folks there is nearly no risk for the Gaming Vid scene,13 年前
19,Dave i know right when Phil was famous,5 年前
20,That's because he actually sounds relatively knowledgeable and polished here with less of his trademark negative behavioral qualities that define his normal video game playthroughs,2 か月前

35,one thing I'm wondering what if its just people from different countries uploading gameplay footage? our government wouldn't have any control over that would they?,13 年前
36,And it has gotten worse The Senate version of the bill does not criminalise the viewing of videos but some analysis of the House version of the bill just made public would criminalise viewing The House version is so bad that even private streaming just your yourself would be a felony under the house version,12 年前
37,@kirbzol What I am asking is that Is creating video for a copyrighted software playing a game or a tutorial for using photoshop considered public performance of a copyrighted material? I am asking if video tutorials falls into this category as well,12 年前
38,GUYS CALM DOWN!!! The Legislative branch proposes silly bills like this all the time besides it's been months this bill will most likely be dismissed and it probably has already they just didn't bother to announce it just calm down we're fine thumbs up so others can see this,12 年前

42,If this bill is passed the government has the power to charge you with copyright infringement regardless of the copyright holders take on the situation,12 年前
43,I agree we should definitely stop this If it passes we must all write letters and emails asking for permission and fill their offices and servers until they get rid of it,12 年前
